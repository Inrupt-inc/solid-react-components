### LogoutButton

This component uses solid-auth-client to provide a simple button that logs out the user. It is a simple helper component to integrate with solid-auth-client.

We re-expose this component from [@solid/react](https://github.com/solid/react-components) library.

```javascript
<LogoutButton />
```
